## Question 1 Analysis
### Dog Walker

This section contains my analysis of Question 1 (Methods and Control Structures):

#### My initial approach during the exam:
- My initial apporach was to write down the initial variables and the method then breaks down the questions.
  - Then I inputs the numAvaiableDog with a for loop within if & else loop to check how many dogs are avauable

#### My revised solution after review:
- Same first step, but the next step is inputs the numAvaiableDog from the previous class, then creates if statement
